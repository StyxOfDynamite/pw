#Better Password Prompts

Heavily inspired by http://aerotwist.com/blog/better-password-form-fields/ I wrote my first JQuery plugin.

###Usage
designed to be as simple as possible, theres probably a million and one things I could do to make this better. I was just keen to try implementing a jQuery "plugin"

1. include the minified css and the js file.
 + `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/passwordField.min.css">`
 + `<script src="js/passwordField.min.js"></script>`
1. that's it.

###How it works
plugin appends some elements to the DOM after the password input field.

###Planned improvements
+ look at setting some options to specify which constraints you want to utilise
+ option to enable / disable tooltips
+ prettier tooltips
